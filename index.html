          <h1>History of Internet in New Zealand
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>1986
Victoria University of Wellington introduced dial-up access to the international USENET (User's Network) - a collection of bulletin boards and discussion groups residing on the Internet.</p>

<p>1989
New Zealand's first link to the Internet was established. This was a link from the University of Waikato to the University of Hawaii.

At this time, New Zealand universities established a loose alliance to establish national Internet infrastructure for education and research. This became known as TUIA Net.

New Zealand's first commercial ISP,  Actrix, was also established in 1989.</p>

<p>1992
TUIA Net became the TUIA Society. Members included the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and other government research groups.
</p>
<p>1994
In response to increasing commercialisation of the Internet, the TUIA Society held a public meeting in November 1994 to establish a new public body to manage Internet infrastructure development.
</p>
<p>1995
In November 1995, the Internet Society of New Zealand (now InternetNZ) was formed.

The management of the .nz name space was transferred to ISOCNZ.

At this time, there were approximately 2000 domain names in the .nz register.

Also at this time, the first flutters of e-commerce were seen with the establishment of Amazon.com.
</p>
<p>1996
ISOCNZ established a subsidiary company The New Zealand Internet Registry Ltd (trading as Domainz) to run the domain name register.

Also in 1996, Telecom entered into the Internet Services Provision and claimed 40,000 users within months.
</p>
<p>2000
ISOCNZ started the process to change the New Zealand Internet Registry into a Shared Registry System (SRS) to create more competition.

Also in 2000, a proposal to expand the .nz namespace by adding a new 2nd Level Domain (2LD) .bank.nz failed to gain support.
</p>
<p>2001
ISOCNZ re-branded to InternetNZ. At this time there were over 100,000 domain names in the .nz register.

A process was also started to add .maori.nz to the .nz namespace.
</p>
<p>2002
.maori.nz was approved and the SRS went live. .nz Registry Services was created and the Office of Domain Name Commissioner was established.</p>

            <h1>Spark New Zealand</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Spark is one of the largest companies by value on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). As of 2007, it was the 39th largest telecommunications company in the OECD. The company is part of New Zealand Telecommunications Forum.</p>

          <h3>Bus Services Infrastruceture</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Wellington has an extensive network of bus routes. Routes are determined by the Regional Council, which regulates commercially provided services and solicits bids from private operators to run the services it is prepared to subsidise. From July 2018, the largest operator is Tranzit Group, which provides services for most of Wellington City the Hutt Valley, and the Wairarapa under the Tranzurban brand. In Porirua and the Kapiti Coast most services are provided by Uzabus. Other bus providers in the region include Mana Coach Services (owner of Newlands Coach Services) which provides services in the northern suburbs and Tawa, and NZ Bus which provides services from Eastbourne and the east-west spine between Karori and Miramar.</p>

<p>Prior to July 2018, the largest operator was NZ Bus, which provided services for most of Wellington City under the GOWellington brand and for the Hutt Valley under the Valley Flyer and Runciman Motors brands. In Porirua and the Kapiti Coast most services were provided by Mana Coach Services.</p>

<p>The majority of buses in the Wellington area are powered by diesel, but GOWellington also had 60 trolleybuses that it operated within Wellington city. The trolleybus network was introduced between 1949 and 1964 to replace Wellington's trams (see below) and closed down in October 2017. From July 2018, Tranzit will introduce electric buses progressively onto their routes; the Greater Wellington Regional Council has also voted to look into proposals to make both rapid transport spines, Johnsonville to Island Bay and Karori to Seatoun, fully electric by 2021 and 2023 respectively and make a core route in both the Hutt Valley and Porirua fully electric as electric buses are introduced. Since 2018, new diesel buses on Metlink routes are required to be at least Euro V standard.</p>

<p>All Metlink buses accept the contactless Snapper card.[10] As of April 2011, Wellington buses report real time location information which is displayed on electronic signs in some Wellington bus stops and can be viewed online.</p>
